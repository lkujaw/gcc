# For table based unwinding on VxWorks, we use two sets of crtstuff objects:
# one with _ctors/_dtors variables to trigger automatic table registrations by
# the vxworks "dynamic" loader, and one without.

# The first set is aimed at modules for Ada applications to be loaded in
# separate parts (e.g. a module for the runtime library).  The second set is
# aimed at other cases, for which another way to trigger the registration
# should be used.  init.c/__gnat_initialize in the GNAT runtime library
# handles that for Ada.

# (crtbeginS/endS) is the (Static) set without the dynamic ctors/dtors.
# (crtbegin/end)   is the second set, with those.
#
# The former is compiled with -fPIC by default, which is useless and
# generates relocation entries that the dynamic loader cannot handle, so...
