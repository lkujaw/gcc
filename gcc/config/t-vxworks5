# Extra gthread support for VxWorks 5.x

# The functions in vxlib.c expect support functions to be provided by the
# kernel. They are not in VxWorks 5.x, and a specific source is contributed in
# the GCC tree to alleviate that. It's comments suggest making it an extra
# kernel module, which is a bit annoying from the procedural standpoint.

# We add it as an extra libgcc component here, where it could easily
# be removed or replaced in case of conflict.
